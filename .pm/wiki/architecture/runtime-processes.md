## Game Client

The client is responsible for:

* Creating the native window
* Polling SDL events
* Reading keyboard and mouse input
* Rendering the world
* Rendering player-facing UI
* Rendering development tools
* Sending input commands to the server
* Predicting local movement
* Replaying unacknowledged inputs after reconciliation
* Buffering and interpolating remote snapshots
* Displaying effects based on authoritative events

The client may predict outcomes for responsiveness, but predicted state is always temporary.

The server can correct:

* Player position
* Velocity
* Health
* Ammunition
* Weapon state
* Alive state
* Match state

The client should be built around the assumption that corrections will happen.

## Dedicated Server

The server is responsible for:

* Accepting client connections
* Assigning connection and player identifiers
* Running the fixed-timestep simulation
* Processing input commands
* Validating player actions
* Updating physics
* Resolving weapon fire
* Applying damage
* Managing health and death
* Managing the safe zone
* Managing match phases
* Determining the winner
* Sending authoritative snapshots
* Resetting the match

The server should run from a terminal or container without requiring a graphical environment.

A server process may initially host one match. Support for multiple matches within one process can be considered later, after the single-match lifecycle is stable.
